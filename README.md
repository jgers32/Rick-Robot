Rick Robot is a tiny land rover on 4 wheels that has sensors, facial recognition, and a claw. It's purpose is to be a personal assistant and to go get whatever you tell it to (via SnowBoy hotwords). 


As of Feburary 2021:

Right now Rick is currently still in his development stages. 

He can identify your face, understand what you say, and can move around (with keyboard input for direction). He can even grab object out in front of him! 
(Also with keyboard input)

His next steps are the be able to put all of those things together.
He will be able to find your face, take input (via microphone), scan the room to find the object, then go retrieve the desired object and bring it back.
